***General Concept***

`MASTER Branch`

    Store all the
    REVIEWED - Currently not needed, don't be bad boi :P
    TESTED - you sure there are no bugs or unneeded command execution? Don't be me!
    POLISHED - good looks are not needed, but good to have for reasons!
    FRIENDLY - manuals and comments, for use and spreading of brain wrinkles!

`YOUR Branch`

    Where you
    STORE - your own scripts!
    FIX - bugs on Master Branch!
    CREATE - new stuff for Master Branch!
    JINX - with other's codes, comments them all, carefree!
    DON'T - jinx other's branch. LOL

`PULLING`

    Relative term, mean [base] PULL data from [remote] for syncing.
    [base] & [remote] could be a repo, a fork, a branch, etc.
    and to be distinguished with

`PULL REQUEST`

    So you made a perfect autopilot, go to sleep, went to jail,
    now feel lonely and wants more jail mates? Perfect, submit your
    bot and let's go to jail together!

    When you want to submit something into MASTER Branch
    from your YOUR Fork or YOUR Branch,
    make a Request and everyone will review for Merging!
    aka REQUEST [remote] PULL data from your [base], hence Pull Request!
    Thank you very much for your contribution!

    Reviewers (could be you too!) have to spend their time reading your code,
    so common senses are to be patient and make sure to the best
    of your capacity, the code you submitted have no issues in it,
    we are all in this together!

`FORK repo`

    For yer seadog lootin our booty! No walk da plank for ya!

    Clone the entire repo (all branches) to
    your account and own it, for evil plans!
    Whereas YOUR Branch is owned by GenesisMudDiscord
    & tends to be used for contributing to MASTER Branch.

    Functionally identical, different in ownership.
