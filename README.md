`MASTER Branch`
    Store all the
    REVIEWED - Currently not needed, don't be bad boi :P
    TESTED - you sure there are no bug or unneeded command execute? Don't be me!
    POLISHED - good looks are not needed, but good to have for reasons!
    FRIENDLY - manuals and comments, for use and spreading of brain wrinkles!

`YOUR Branch`
    Where you
    STORE - your own scripts!
    FIX - bugs on Master Branch!
    CREATE - new stuffs for Master Branch!
    JINX - with other's codes, comments them all, carefree!
    DON'T - jinx other's branch. LOL

`REVIEW Branch`
    For scripts that you would like others to review before merge into Master,
    push them here and make a Pull Request!

`PULLING`
    Sync the repo to your machine, for local work!
    and to be distinguished with

`PULL REQUEST`
    So you made a perfect autopilot, go to sleep, went to jail,
    now feel lonely and wants more jail mates? Perfect, submit your
    bot and lets go to jail together!

    When you wants to submit something into MASTER Branch
    from your own FORK or YOUR Branch,
    make a Request and everyone will review for Merging!
    aka pull it into our MASTER Branch, hence Pull Request!
    Thank you very much for your contribution!

    Reviewers (could be you too!) have to spends their time to read your code,
    so common senses are to be patience and make sure to the best
    of your capacity the code you submitted have no issues in it,
    we are all in this together!

`FORK repo`
    For yer seadog lootin our booty! No walk da plank for ya!

    Clone entire repo (all branches) to
    your account and own it, for evil plans!
    Whereas YOUR Branch are owned by GenesisMudDiscord
    & tends to be use for contributing to MASTER Branch.

    Functionally identical, different in ownership.
